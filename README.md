# Website Monitor Bot

It reads a list of websites and fetches each one to get its status code. If there is any down, send an email notification warning you.

## Customizable Spreadsheet

A simple spreadsheet has been developed if you want to monitor your own domains. You can get your own copy by clicking the link below:

### How it works:
1. At the "Configuration" sheet put your name, email, and select the best our to send you warnings.
2. At the "Domain Monitoring" sheet put the names of the domains you want to monitor in column A.
3. In the menu, go to "Monitoring Menu" to install the trigger by clicking at "Set your trigger - run just once".

**Please note:** the first time you click you will be asked to authorize the script so you can run it on your Google account. After you authorize, you run the script. Thus, you might need to click twice on "Set your trigger - run just once".

### Try it out:

You can put some broken examples like "example123.com" to make sure that the script is properly running on your account.
In the "Monitoring Menu", click at "Monitor your websites" to manually run the bot and get the current status of your websites.
After running the script, if you get any error message you will clearly see it on your screen and also receive an email notification. If everything is ok, a green flag is going to be shown next to your domain name.
